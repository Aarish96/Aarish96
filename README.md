# Real-Time Computer Vision Pose Detection System

This project aims to develop a computer vision-based pose detection system that accurately detects human poses from videos and images. The system is versatile, with applications in fitness apps, interactive gaming, and sports analytics, providing feedback on posture and performance. It tracks body landmarks such as elbows, shoulders, and knees, and enables real-time analysis of human movement patterns.

## Project Overview
The goal is to design a model that can recognize and analyze human poses, allowing users to improve their movements and track performance. With real-time feedback, the system enhances user experience across various interactive domains.

### Project Goals
- Develop a real-time pose detection system using computer vision.
- Detect and classify at least three distinct poses with a minimum of 10-15 key body points.
- Achieve over 50% accuracy in pose detection and classification.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset includes multiple videos, each representing different body movements such as dance and exercises.
- **Selection**: From the provided master dataset, we selected 10-12 diverse videos for training. Each video represents various poses and environments.

## Preprocessing
1. **Frame Extraction**: Extract frames from each video.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Apply image processing techniques such as brightness adjustment, rotation, and cropping.
3. **Landmark Labeling**: Each frame is labeled with skeletal points to establish ground truth.
4. **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand pose and movement patterns. Key findings include:
- Common patterns in human motion detected in various activities.
- Distinctive skeletal landmarks and movement flows.

## Model Selection
- **Pose Detection Models**: We experimented with models like [OpenPose](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/02/pose-detection-using-computer-vision/) and [PoseNet](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection), choosing the one with optimal accuracy and speed.
- **Training Parameters**: Batch size, learning rate, and the number of epochs were fine-tuned for improved accuracy.

## Model Design and Training
Using Python, we implemented the pose detection model in Jupyter Notebook. Key details:
- **Model Architecture**: Based on the selected pose detection model.
- **Training Method**: Optimized to detect skeletal landmarks with high precision.
- **Accuracy Achieved**: The model achieved a validation accuracy of approximately 65%, detecting skeletal landmarks like elbows, shoulders, and knees accurately.

## Evaluation and Testing
- **Testing**: The model was tested on a variety of videos to ensure robustness.
- **Performance Metrics**: The model achieved an accuracy of over 50% on new pose classifications.
- **Testing Observations**: Demonstrated strong performance in different real-world scenarios.

## Model Deployment
- **Platform**: Google Colab was used for testing and deploying the model.
- **Files**: Upload `PoseDetectionModel.ipynb` and related `.py` scripts to this repository.

## Future Scope
To maintain and enhance the system:
1. Incorporate additional pose variations.
2. Optimize model accuracy for new applications, including sports analytics and physical therapy.
